## Working with GitHub Branches

GitHub branches are essential tools for collaborative development and code management:

- **Feature Development:** Create separate branches for new features, keeping the main branch stable
- **Code Review:** Branches enable isolated code reviews before merging into main
- **Experiment Safely:** Test new ideas without affecting production code
- **Parallel Development:** Multiple developers can work on different features simultaneously
- **Version Control:** Maintain different versions of your code for various environments (dev, staging, prod)
- **Conflict Resolution:** Branches help manage and resolve code conflicts systematically

Best practices for branch management:
- Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`, `bugfix/login-error`)
- Keep branches short-lived and focused on specific tasks
- Regularly sync with the main branch to avoid large merge conflicts
- Delete branches after successful merging to keep the repository clean
